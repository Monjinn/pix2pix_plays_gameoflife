# Pix2pix plays Conway's Game Of Life
A machine learning program called Pix2pix which utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks *(GANs)* was trained to play Conway's Game of Life cellular automaton. The network was trained using a dataset which consists of 100 image with 512x512 resolution. Training run 200 epochs with default settings defined by [original authors of Pix2pix](https://phillipi.github.io/pix2pix/).
